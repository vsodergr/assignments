# Viktor's Book Store

This is my super good book store. Enjoy!

## Build Instructions

Within the 'cmake_bookstore' directory, create a 'build' directory and move into it.

`$ mkdir build`

`$ cd build`

Then configure cmake from the build directory.

`$ cmake ..`

If you encounter no errors you should be able to build the application with a simple command from the build directory.

`$ make`

## Run Instructions

Once built simply run the file 'viktors_bookstore' in the build directory and follow the menu options.

`$ ./viktors_bookstore`
